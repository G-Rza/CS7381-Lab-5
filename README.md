# CS7381-Lab-5

Dataset Selection
Select a dataset similarly to lab one. That is, the dataset must be table data and must have categorical features. In terms of generalization performance, it is helpful to have a large dataset for building a wide and deep network. It is also helpful to have many different categorical features to create the embeddings and cross-product embeddings. It is fine to perform binary classification, multi-class classification, or regression. You are NOT allowed to use the census (i.e., Adult) dataset that was given as an example in class. 

Grading Rubric
Preparation (4 points total)
[1 points] Define and prepare your class variables. Use proper variable representations (int, float, one-hot, etc.). Use pre-processing methods (as needed) for dimensionality reduction, scaling, etc. Remove variables that are not needed/useful for the analysis. Describe the final dataset that is used for classification/regression (include a description of any newly formed variables you created). You have the option of using tf.dataset for processing, but it is not required. 
[1 points] Identify groups of features in your data that should be combined into cross-product features. Provide a compelling justification for why these features should be crossed (or why some features should not be crossed). 
[1 points] Choose and explain what metric(s) you will use to evaluate your algorithmâ€™s performance. You should give a detailed argument for why this (these) metric(s) are appropriate on your data. That is, why is the metric appropriate for the task (e.g., in terms of the business case for the task). Please note: rarely is accuracy the best evaluation metric to use. Think deeply about an appropriate measure of performance.
[1 points] Choose the method you will use for dividing your data into training and testing (i.e., are you using Stratified 10-fold cross validation? Shuffle splits? Why?). Explain why your chosen method is appropriate or use more than one method as appropriate. Argue why your cross validation method is a realistic mirroring of how an algorithm would be used in practice. Use the method to split your data that you argue for. 

Modeling (5 points total)
[2 points] Create at least three combined wide and deep networks to classify your data using Keras (this total of "three" includes the model you will train in the next step of the rubric). Visualize the performance of the network on the training data and validation data in the same plot versus the training iterations.
Note: you can use the "history" return parameter that is part of Keras "fit" function to easily access this data.
[2 points] Investigate generalization performance by altering the number of layers in the deep branch of the network. Try at least two models (this "two" includes the wide and deep model trained from the previous step). Use the method of cross validation and evaluation metric that you argued for at the beginning of the lab to answer: What model with what number of layers performs superiorly? Use proper statistical methods to compare the performance of different models.
[1 points] Compare the performance of your best wide and deep network to a standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Alternatively, you can compare to a network without the wide branch (i.e., just the deep network). For classification tasks, compare using the receiver operating characteristic and area under the curve. For regression tasks, use Bland-Altman plots and residual variance calculations.  Use proper statistical methods to compare the performance of different models.  

Exceptional Work (1 points total)
5000 students: You have free reign to provide additional analyses.
One idea (required for 7000 level students): Capture the embedding weights from the deep network and (if needed) perform dimensionality reduction on the output of these embedding layers (only if needed). That is, pass the observations into the network, save the embedded weights (called embeddings), and then perform  dimensionality reduction in order to visualize results. Visualize and explain any clusters in the data.
